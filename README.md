# ETL Project Proposal
Data Analytics Bootcamp Class Project

Car Data
Members: Carlos Cocuy, Rebeca Rodriguez, John Fowler 
## Source of Data
Dataset is a csv file on Car Sales. (link: https://www.kaggle.com/hsinha53/car-sales)
And a csv on Traffic Violations (link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations-56dda)
Goals to achieve:
 - Create table on manufacturer by sales
 - Create a table on car details (Horsepower, Wheelbase, Width, Length, Curb weight,Fuel capacity, Fuel efficiency) for each make
 - Create a table on resale value and current sale for each make

## Type of Transformation Needed 
  -	Sorting and aggregating to get sales for each manufacturer
 - Filtering and dropping columns to make all tables

## Final Product Database:
NoSQL Database: MongoDB
## Final Tables
  -	Table on manufacturer by sales
  - Table on car details (Horsepower, Wheelbase, Width, Length, Curb weight,Fuel capacity, Fuel efficiency) for each make
  - Table on resale value and current sale for each make
